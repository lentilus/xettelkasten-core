# XeTtelkasten : Backend for LaTex based Zettelkasten

## The Idea

Generally speaking - a [Zettelkasten (slipbox)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) is strategy for organizing scrientific or litery work. Information is condenced into atomic concepts. Each zettel is the manifestation of a concepts. Zettels with related concepts should link to another.

This strategy is very well suited for digial work. Each zettel is a file. A link to a zettel is a hyperref to the zettels file.
For this reason there are tons of apps (Obsidian, Zettlr, Logseq, etc) implementing this paradigm. The issue for me is, that most of them are markdown or plain text based, which is a dealbreaker for me, because I want to use the full power of LaTex (not just some speced-down markdown-version).

The solution I came up with is very light weight, extensible, and could be used with any plain text file format. (It just happes to be LaTeX for me - hence XeTtelkasten : TeX-Zettelkasen)
